My second official research paper was on History of Clockmaking with a linear association of time. The time-constraint was specified from 1800s to 1850s. In this paper, I began exploring the reasons why clocks—an irreplaceable device—was not universally present. I was astounded by my findings, though my thoughts were later replaced by quasi-darwinian ideology.

Ultimately, my results indicated that clocks were considerably expensive and were regarded only as a symbol of wealth and luxury, leaving our current idea of clocks as a meaningless thought. Even more interesting was the fact that this topic, however so interesting it may be, was never before written about.
